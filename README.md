# Minecord
**What is this!?**
Basically, create a minecraft server through discord.

__Purpose of the project:__
- Create a minecraft server through discord. Yea, real fast. You want to stop it? No problem, you can do it really quick too :).
- **Usage**: `rinit` to start a random server (Might take a while to load in the minecraft client to create a world).
- **Usage**: `rstop` to basically, stop the server from running (this procedure is instant, since the tunnel just closes).

_Pros/Cons:_
- **Pro**: Its really fast if the server is stored locally or even a VPS.
- **Dis**: You might install some anticheat measures.

__Future of the project:__
At the moment, I plan to implement remote command execution (basically the mc console but in discord).
The version of the server relies on you. Make sure that you have opened the port that you need to make
public the ngrok IP, so that way you can tunnel your localhost/vps or any host servicie.
